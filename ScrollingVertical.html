      <a href="#story2">Down</a>
      <p>&emsp;One of the first people to walk down the aisle of lane ten that day was an elderly woman with a cart full of groceries. I went through my normal routine of cleaning down the belt and apologizing for the wait.</p>
      <p>“Sorry about that, we’re just trying to keep everything clean. How are you?”</p>
      <p>“I’m good, how are you?”</p>
      <p>“Good; just trying to keep everything clean, keep things moving."</p>
      <p>&emsp;We continued to chat as I scanned and bagged her groceries. Eventually, we came to talking about her granddaughter. The woman said that she hadn’t been able to see her 18-month-old granddaughter during the heightened social distancing measures, which was especially hard given that the woman usually watched her granddaughter while the girl’s parents were at work. She talked about how hard it had been to go from seeing her granddaughter for ten or more hours a day to only over the occasional Facetime. The woman said that whenever they did videochat, her granddaughter seemed more confused and upset than anything, and would cry “grandma!” at the screen, confused at why her caretaker wasn’t there in person.</p>
      <p>&emsp;But she was more worried about her grandson. He had been brought to the hospital for a severe case of dehydration. She, of course, was not allowed to visit him, as the hospital was trying to keep family members out of the Emergency Room to slow the spread of the virus. Her worried expression turned to one of frustration.</p>
      <p>“This would all go away if people would just do what they're supposed to.”</p>
      <p>&emsp;I agreed, bagged the remainder of her groceries, and gave her a receipt. The quick transition between grandmotherly concern and grandmotherly anger stuck with me. I only hoped that she would get to see her grandkids again soon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story2">
      <p>&emsp;A while later, a man came down my aisle with a cartful of groceries. He looked to be stocking up for a while. I scanned some meat, boxes of macaroni, and a couple boxes of cereal.</p>
      <p>“Do you have kids at home?”</p>
      <p>“Two. They’re going nuts.”</p>
	    <p>&emsp;We traded stories about boys (his sons, my brothers,) stuck at home making trouble and neglecting their online school. I scanned four one-and-a-half-gallon jugs of water on the bottom of his cart. I asked about his Rick and Morty shirt, prompting a conversation about the most recent episodes of the show. As I was scanning a loaf of bread and we were chatting about the upcoming May 3rd Rick and Morty release, my manager walked by. Something on the floor seemed to catch her eye, and she walked over to me.</p>
      <p>“You do know that there's a two-item-per-guest limit on water, right?” she asked me. I had completely forgotten that water products were part of the pandemic shopping limitations, as I had primarily had to enforce the 1-item limit on paper products. She apologized to the man and reclaimed two of the water jugs as I deducted the jugs from his total.</p>
      <p>&emsp;Not particularly knowing how to behave now that my manager had just taken two of his waters, I continued bagging the man’s items and making the occasional small talk. I mentioned that I was from Colorado, and he told me about how he’d always wanted to live in the mountains. As my manager walked by again, he raised his voice a tad and said “it just sucks that my family of four only has ten gallons of water to drink for the week.” It wasn’t at all related to our conversation, so I was taken aback. After she had passed, he just continued our conversation as if nothing had happened. He fuddled with the card machine for a minute or so. (The reader is finicky sometimes.) I gave him his receipt and wished him luck keeping his kids occupied during social distancing. He thanked me and went on his way. </p>
      <a href="#story1">Back up</a>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story3">
      <p>&emsp;	A woman approached the belt with an unusually full cart. Her cartload did not, however, consist of the food or household essentials that most of the other guests had. Her cart was overflowing with Easter supplies. I rang up peeps, chocolate bunnies, candy eggs. I rang up two woven baskets and two packs of easter grass. I rang up water guns and toys and plastic easter eggs. I rang up clothing with bunnies and cutesy Easter puns on them.</p>
      <p>“Do you have kids at home?”</p>
      <p>“Yep!”</p>
      <p>“Are they looking forward to Easter?”</p>
      <p>“Mmhm.”</p>
      <p>&emsp;	She pulled her phone from her pocket, signaling that our conversation was over. I didn’t particularly mind. I was fairly entertained watching the climbing total on the cash register screen. I finally scanned and bagged the last item, and checked the screen to read the woman her total. She whipped out a credit card, swiped it, and was on her way. I felt bad for being judgemental, but I just couldn’t shake it from my mind: her cartload of Easter supplies cost more than an entire month’s worth of my wages. I don’t know if that made me feel resentful, or sad, or just sorry for her kids who would be wearing frilly “hoppy easter” shirts for the rest of the month. However it made me feel, it certainly stuck with me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story4">
      <p>&emsp;	A man and his young daughter rolled their cart up. I wiped down the belt, and apologized for the wait. I felt especially bad since they had already been waiting for a while behind the previous shopper: the woman with the Easter supplies. </p>
      <p>“That’s okay. We just appreciate that you’re here,” the man said. It was a relief to hear.</p>
      <p>&emsp; I scanned and bagged their few groceries before encountering an Amazon Fire TV stick. Like most electronics, the remote had a pesky anti-theft box around it. My heart dropped. I knew that I was about to make this man and his daughter’s already long wait even longer; no matter how many times anyone teaches me, I always struggle with removing security devices. I kept my cool, and unhooked the security device removal tool from its place at my register. I ran the edge of the tool along the lid of the security box and waited for a click. I heard the click, and tried to unlock the box. No dice. I tried again. And again. I fumbled with the box a few more times before flashing my lane light to flag down a manager. Eventually she came over, unlocked the box — I felt ever so slightly better since she also struggled with it for a moment before popping the box open — and left. I sheepishly scanned the remote and read the man his total. He swiped his credit card, and took his bags. As I was beginning to wipe down the belt for the next customer, he pulled a ten dollar bill out of his wallet and placed it on the counter. </p>
      <p>“That’s your tip for being here.” He left before I could say anything.</p>
      <p>&emsp;	I wasn’t particularly sure what to do. I tucked the bill to the side of my register and started ringing up the next customer. As I bagged her first item, I noticed that the man had forgotten a bag on the bagging counter; the very Fire stick with which I had fumbled for so long. I was horrified that after all of the wait that I had put him through for the fairly expensive device, he had left it.</p>
      <p>“Ma’m, if you’d excuse me for one moment, I’m just going to go make sure that a customer doesn’t leave without this bag.”</p>
      <p>&emsp;	I grabbed the bag and sprinted out the exit. In retrospect, I must have looked completely deranged sprinting out the door with a single bag. Once I was outside, I scanned the parking lot, and saw the man and his daughter loading groceries into their trunk. I ran across the parking lot.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me, sir?” The man was clearly surprised to see me. “I’m so sorry, but I didn’t want you to forget your bag.” I meekly offered up the plastic bag. The man thanked me for the bag, and I ran back inside, now terrified that I would have upset the next customer with my absence. I rounded the coralle of carts and screeched to a halt at my register. </p>
      <p>“Sorry about the wait, ma’m,” I said, still catching my breath.</p>
      <p>“Do you run track?” she asked incredulously. I nodded, and we talked about hurdles as I scanned her groceries. With the NEPSTA season cancelled, it looked like hurdling over shopping carts would have to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story5">
      <p>&emsp;		A woman approached with a basket of groceries. I asked her how her day was, and she talked about the weather as I bagged her items. </p>
      <p>“Strange times that we live in,” she said.</p>
      <p>“How are you holding up with all of this craziness?” I asked.</p>
      <p>“Well you know, I really don’t understand it all. I think that it’s really just a ruckus that’s been kicked up by the media. President Trump says that it’s all fake, so I’m not too worried,” She replied. I struggled not to raise an eyebrow.</p>
      <p>“Mmm.” My ambiguous grunt seemed to be a satisfactory indication of agreement to her. I bagged the rest of the groceries as she pulled cash from her wallet.</p>
      <p>“Have a lovely rest your day,” I said as I handed the woman her change and a receipt.</p>
      <p>“You too, hon,” she replied cheerily before turning and walking away. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story6">
      <p>&emsp;	As I finished up with a customer, I grabbed the cleaning solution and a new wipe. I was used to having to ask customers to wait to start loading their groceries onto the belt, but the man who was next in line was maintaining a hefty distance. His beard was pinched against his face by an N95 mask; he was definitely taking as many precautions as he could. I wiped down the belt as he waited back beyond the magazine rack. </p>
      <p>“Alrighty, you can start loading whenever you’re ready. Sorry about that wait, we’re just trying to keep everything clean.” </p>
      <p>&emsp; Normally a guest might respond with “oh, that’s alright,” or “okay.” The man didn’t say anything, but I didn’t think much of it. I started scanning his items.</p>
      <p>“How are you today?” I asked. No response. I looked up to see the man staring back at me. I held eye contact for a moment, before jerking my gaze back to the scanner. I bagged the rest of his groceries in silence. I rang up his total. He swiped his card. I handed him his receipt.</p>
      <p>“Have a nice day.”</p>
      <p>&emsp; He turned and left without a response.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beltitem" id="story7">
      <p>&emsp;	A couple approached my register with a basket of groceries. What struck me about them was that I actually recognized them. I had rung them up just a couple of days prior. They didn’t seem to remember me, but that was okay. They were just as friendly as they had been the first time. They asked if they could use a reusable basket that they had brought instead of plastic bags. I told them that yes, they could, but I wasn’t allowed to handle any reusable bags. The woman said that this was fine, and the man swung a basket up onto the bagging station to begin loading their groceries. I laughed out loud. The basket was about the same size and shape of a normal handheld basket that you’d use in a grocery store, except the basket was lined in recycled jeans to make the entire basket look like an enormous pair of jean shorts. They seemed excited that I enjoyed their basket. I rang up their groceries and wished them a nice day. </p>
